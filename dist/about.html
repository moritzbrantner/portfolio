                <h5> Development and Introduction of a Prototypical Data Analysis Platform</h5>
                <p> A typical IT-service business uses many application and external services to plan,
                    manage and execute their projects and internal operations.
                    All of these applications often contain the same data
                    (about users, projects and bills) in different forms and versions.
                    This situation is prone to error and inconsistencies.
                    In order to solve these problems a prototypical data analysis platform was designed
                    and implemented. This way data can be extracted, curated and shared across the different
                    management tools used by the IT-service business.</p>
